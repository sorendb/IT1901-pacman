## What have we done since the second release?

For the third release, the group got the choice of either extending the JavaFX application with new functionality or create a new client with new technology such as React. After some discussion, the consensus leaned towards sticking with JavaFX, as we saw it more natural to implement the functionality we wanted, before creating a client. 

After some discussion, the consensus leaned towards sticking with JavaFX, as none of the team members had earlier experience with the new frontend technologies suggested. Although it would be interesting to learn something new, we concluded it would be very time consuming and an unreliable factor to the project.

<br>

### 1. Implemented new functionality

As mentioned above, we chose to implement new functionality for our application.

This is what we chose to implement for the 3rd release, based upon [Userstory4](/pacMan-application/docs/userstories/userstory4.md):

- Ghosts: Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde from the original PacMan game have added to the gave. If they collide with PacMan, it's game over.

- Berries: after playing a while a berry pops up on the screen, and if PacMan eats it, it gets an extra score
- Color choice: you can now chose PacMan to 4 different colours: pink, green, yellow and orange.

<br>

### 2. Implemented REST API with SpringBoot

One of the primary goals for this release is to eliminate the need for the client to store their highscores locally. Instead we aim to implement a REST API to enable that the application stores highscores remotely on a server. This implementation has numerous benefits, but most importantly the ability for multiple users to save theirhigh scores in the same place. This means that users can compete with eachother indirectly from different machines.

There are numerous ways to implement a RESTAPI, and we chose to use Spring Boot which is a tool that makes this possible. We opted for Spring Boot due to its inherent simplicity, widespread adoption, and its significant relevance in professional settings.

<br>

### 3. Written tests for new functionality and generally improved the test coverage

The implementation of the RestAPI as well as adding new functionality to the application led to many new classes and methods in multiple modules.
In other words, a lot of new code needed to be tested in order to maintain a good test coverage.

More on the finalized tests made for release3 can be found at the bottom of the READMEs for each of the modules:

- [Approach to testing in Core](/pacMan-application/core/README.md#approach-to-testing-of-the-core-module)

- [Approach to testing in UI](/pacMan-application/ui/README.md#approach-to-testing-of-the-ui-module)

- [Approach to testing in Restserver](/pacMan-application/springboot/restserver/README.md#approach-to-testing-of-the-springbootrestserver-module)


<br>

### 4. Updated the package- class- and sequential-diagram with PlantUML

In the new release we have added a new sequential diagram that shows how storage is done remotely. This makes it easier to understand the similarities and differences between local and remote storage. Also the other diagram: class and architecture have been updated so that they now include the new functionality and restserver implementation. You can read more about the diagrams and see them [here](/pacMan-application/docs/diagrams/release3/README.md).


<br>

### 5. Made the application a shippable product

The project has been configured with *jlink* and *jpackage* to produce a shippable product for the end user. After completing the [initial installation](/pacMan-application/README.md#clean-install) of the project, ensure the terminal is still in **/pacMan-application** and run the following commands **(Windows/Mac)**:

```bat
mvn clean
```

```bat
cd ui
mvn javafx:jlink
```

This will produce a file named *"PacManfx.zip"* in **pacMan-application/ui/target**.
Then (still in the /ui-folder) run the following command:

```bat
mvn jpackage:jpackage
```

This will produce a folder *"/dist"* in **pacMan-application/ui/target**, with an executable file inside named *"PacManfx-1.0.0.exe"*. This is the installer for the program. Run this file to install the package on your system. The program can then be run from a .exe-file in the installation-directory.

Remember to [start the server](/pacMan-application/README.md#start-the-server) before running the app, or else an error will occur when the score is saved.
<br>

### 6. Improved our code quality
Multiple tools have been used to ensure a high degree of quality in our code. Spotbugs and Checkstyle has been used for this. The current release has zero checkstyle warnings, and every class is formatted according to Google Style. Spotbugs does show a warning about certain "classes needed for analysis were missing", but this has been determined to be a bug with Spotbugs documented [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56279567/how-to-fix-the-following-classes-needed-for-analysis-were-missing).
<br>
Older code has also been revised, so that no duplicate code is present. This involved rewriting certain methods to also be used in tests, using inheritance and moving code out of the controllers.

## Comment on implicit storage
In our program PacMan, we have chosen to use implicit storage, meaning that
the user doesn't have to handle the storage process. 
In other words, when a user interacts with the program, such as saving their 
name, our program automatically determines the appropriate location for 
storing this data. This makes it easier for users to manage their data, since 
they don't need to worry about the details surrounding the storage process, 
and therefore giving a more user-friendly experience.
