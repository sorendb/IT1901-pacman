## PacMan - User story 4
**Eric**
<br>

Eric is 14 years old, gets easily bored, loves challenges and has a lot of energy.
His favourite color is orange and he loves speed, excitement and adrenalin. 
In the weekends, he enjoys to play old school arcade games that raises his pulse a bit, and PacMan is one of his favourites.

As a user of the applicaton, Eric wishes to change the color of PacMan to orange which is his personal favourite. 
In addition, since he is easily bored with games, he wants functionality that makes the game more challenging and exciting. Eric wants multiple ghosts moving around in the maze and special elements other than pellets that are more difficult to eat. If he bumps into one of the ghosts, the game is over and if he manages to eat the difficult element, he wants to be awarded with more points. He believes this would make the game more challenging and fun.
