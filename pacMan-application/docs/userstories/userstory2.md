## PacMan - User Story 2
**Selma**
<br>
Selma is 15 years old, and is extremely competetive.
She uses the application PacMan, because she and her friends wants the long bus ride to school to seem faster. 

As a player, Selma wishes to see a highscore list at the end of each game, so she can see who is the best player amongst the friend group and who she needs to beat the next time. 

### Important features I, Selma, would like to see:
- Username and corresponding score on a highscore list at the end of each game

### Important features I, Selma, would like to do:
- Save a username before each game, so that we can keep track of who has gotten which score
