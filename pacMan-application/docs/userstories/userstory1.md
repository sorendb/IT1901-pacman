## PacMan - User story 1
**Roger**
<br>
Roger is 18 years old, introverted and he loves gaming. He uses the application PacMan in his Norwegian class in school, because he finds Norwegian language history extremely boring. 

As a user of the application, Roger wishes to move PacMan by using his arrow keys because this is a lot more simple than physically clicking arrow buttons with his touchpad. Also, he would like to have pellets spread across the game maze, so he can increase his score by running over them (eating them). This brings an element of excitement and competition into the game. Roger also wants his current score to be visible during the game, so it is easier to follow how well he is doing.

### Important features I, Roger, would like to see:
- A start screen
- A PacMan-figure
- A maze/game board
- Pellets spread across the maze
- My own score whilst playing

### Important features I, Roger, would like to do:
- Be able to control PacMan with my arrow keys
- Gather points by eating/running PacMan over pellets
- PacMan should stop moving when I collide with walls in the maze
