# README for release 2 of PacMan



This is the README for the second release of our PacMan game.

## What have we done since the first release?

### 1. Changed the file structure from javafx-template to modular file structure
   
   Our application is now split into a three-tier architecture. We have the
   - presentation tier; the userinterface (**ui**-folder)
   - application tier; the logic (**core**-folder)
   - data tier; the storing of the application data (**json**)

```

  

README-files for these tiers can be found in both core and ui-folder.

### 2. Implemented some new features
   - The board is filled with pellets
   - A soundtrack is added to enhance resembelence with the old-school PacMan
   - The score is visible in the top right corner whilst playing
   - Possible to switch between light mode and dark mode

Images that illustrates these photos can be found at the bottom of this README-file. 

<br>

### 3. Improved the test coverage
   
   We have written a more detailed test for the user-interface and PacManController ([PacManAppTest](/pacMan-application/ui/src/test/java/ui/PacManAppTest.java))
   We now have a test coverage on 38% in core, 82% in persistence  and 71% in ui.

   The two photos of the generated jacoco-reports can be found in docs>release2. 

<br>
   
### 4. Connected our data tier to JSON

   Userdata is now stored in [Scores](/pacMan-application/ui/src/main/resources/ui/JSON/scores.json) as a .json file, instead of being stored in a .txt-file. This has a few practical consequences:

   - Instead of storing the userdata as strings in a .txt file, the scores are stored as objects
  
   - An object of this type (PacManUser), is an object that stores the username (String) and the score (int) of the player.
  
   - This has been changed since JSON allows text representation of java-objects. This makes the code easier to understand than with strings.
  
   - The conversion from java-objects to JSON and back has been done with GSON in the class [PacManPersistence.java](/pacMan-application/core/src/main/java/Persistence/PacManPersistence.java) to simplify the conversion-process. Version of the GSON-dependency is documented in the root-README.

### 5. Created a package-diagram, seqential-diagram and class-diagram with PlantUML
   
   The package-diagram demonstrates the relationship inbetween the different packages/modules, as well as their dependencies

   The sequential-diagram illustrates the sequence of messages between objects in an interaction

   The class-diagram gives a clear picture on how the different classes are connected. 

   The diagrams can be found in the [diagrams-folder](/pacMan-application/docs/diagrams/release2) for release 2, both photos of them and their PlantUML script.

### 6. Implemented Spotbugs and Checkstyle
   
   Spotbugs and Checkstyle are tools for checking our code quality. While Spotbugs looks for bug patterns in the code, Checkstyle makes sure that our code adheres to a coding standard. Together with jacoco which was implemented in release 1, these tools guarantee a solid code quality check.

   A more thorough explination on these tools can be found [here](/pacMan-application/docs/codequality/README.md).

<br>

### 7. Implemented Eclipse Che
   
   Eclipse Che is a Cloud Developement Environtment (CDE), allowing us to access the project by a URL. This cloud-based approach enhances accessibility to and collaboration on the project by requiring only a web browser and an internet connection. Additionally, Eclipse Che offers time-saving benefits, as the entire development environment comes preconfigured, and it automates the Git setup process.

   Click the link below to open the PacMan-project in Eclipse Che. Please note you must have access to the repository in GitLab, as this is a private project.

## Our workflow and workhabits

We have written about our workflow and work habits  [here](/pacMan-application/docs/workflow/README.md).



## Our approach to testing

Updated documentation on our finalized approach to testing can be found [here](/pacMan-application/docs/testing/README.md).

# Images from the game

The board is now filled with pellets, and you can see the player's score in the top right corner.

<br>
Ligth mode can be enabled/disabled from start screen by a toggle switch

![LightmodeToggle](src/main/resources/README-Images/../../../../../../ui/PacMan/ui/README-Images/light-mode-toggle.png)

Ligth mode visualised with a lighter maze and an orange PacMan
