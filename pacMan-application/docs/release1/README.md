# README for release 1 of PacMan

(Please read the README in the root folder before this.)

This is the README for the first release of our PacMan game.

The first release of PacMan contains basic gameplay mechanics. It includes: 
- A PacMan that is controllable with the corresponding arrow-keys
- A map with functional walls
- A set of "pellets", that PacMan is supposed to collect
- A scoring system to keep track of how many pellets PacMan has collected
- A system for storing scores, reading and displaying highscores
- Functionality for replay
- A user story to highlight the possibilities and limitations of the game
- Documentation of the current state of the game

# Goal for final release

The goal for the final release of this project is for the application to resemble the PacMan video game as closely as practicable. Ideally, in future releases the board would have a full set of pellets, power pellets would be implemented and four monsters would roam the board trying to catch PacMan. The highscore list would will be store globally as well as locally in future releases
